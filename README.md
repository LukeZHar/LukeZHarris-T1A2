## Target audience
This content is designed to be viewed by __Coder Academy__ for my T1A2 assessment and also potentially in the future by __Employers__  

## Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
The tech stacks used in this portfolio include: VSCode for writing the HTML code and designing with style of the pages with CSS, Github repository for storing my commited work, and Netlify for deploying the final website.  

R1	Implement no less than four HTML documents which link together and share a common theme, including components to present the following information:
- Your name and contact details
- Links to professional accounts such as Github and LinkedIn
- Your work and/or study history and a link to a PDF of your resume (resume can be a mock up)
- Content about you to demonstrate your personality, skills and/or interests
- A list of blog posts with titles and date published
- A blog with FIVE sample posts (placeholder text can be used), blog posts need to have at least ONE image each

R2	Create FOUR components which contain text content that are styled appropriately for audience. You must:
- write CSS to style each component, or substantially override a CSS framework’s styles with your own
- place comments in the CSS and HTML code to identify each component
- have your custom styles or overrides in a separate stylesheet
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility

R3	Create FOUR components using HTML and CSS to contain graphical content that are appropriate for audience. You must:
- write CSS to style each component, or substantially override a CSS framework’s styles with your own
- place comments in the CSS and HTML code to indentify each component
- have your custom styles or overrides in a separate stylesheet
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility

NOTE: you may create a component to contain an image and caption that could be reused across the site.

R4	Create a responsive layout for each page using HTML and CSS utilising Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to produce a responsive layout that:
- will display all components at desktop, mobile, and tablet viewport widths
- includes a navigation bar and/or header/sidebar

All components should:
- use valid HTML5 elements
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility

R5	An overview/sitemap of all the pages on your website	The overall structure of your website and how different pages will be navigated


R6	Wireframes or mockups of the pages of your website	Your decision making process relating to the overall aesthetic of your website


R7	A list of components that will be used	How components and styling will engage the audience
