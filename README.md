R1	Implement no less than four HTML documents which link together and share a common theme, including components to present the following information:
- Your name and contact details

- Content about you to demonstrate your personality, skills and/or interests
- A list of blog posts with titles and date published
- A blog with FIVE sample posts (placeholder text can be used), blog posts need to have at least ONE image each

R2	Create FOUR components which contain text content that are styled appropriately for audience. You must:
- write CSS to style each component, or substantially override a CSS framework’s styles with your own
- place comments in the CSS and HTML code to identify each component
- have your custom styles or overrides in a separate stylesheet
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility

- have your custom styles or overrides in a separate stylesheet
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility

NOTE: you may create a component to contain an image and caption that could be reused across the site.

R4	Create a responsive layout for each page using HTML and CSS utilising Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to produce a responsive layout that:

- includes a navigation bar and/or header/sidebar

All components should:
